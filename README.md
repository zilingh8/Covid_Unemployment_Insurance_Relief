# Covid_Unemployment_Insurance_Relief

In this group school project, we look at Covid-19 data to answer our chosen research question:

### How effective is Unemployment Insurance and Stimulus Relief at reducing infection rate per 100,000 people across US States?

We apply linear regression to study and analyze the spread of Covid.

R Code and Dataset : This contains our R markdown code and dataset of (i) Variables representing the spread of the disease; (ii) Variables representing state-level policy responses; and, (iii) General state-level characteristics sourced from the CDC and Kaiser Family Foundation.
